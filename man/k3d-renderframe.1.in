.SH DESCRIPTION

.IP
Currently, K\-3D implements a simple system for queueing rendering jobs on the local host. When the user initiates a job (such as rendering a preview image, rendering a final frame, or rendering an animation), a job directory is created (usually in /tmp, although this can be configured). The job directory contains a lock file, a control file named control.k3d, and one-to-many numbered frame directories. The name of the lock file changes to flag the sta.IP
tus of the job as "ready", "running", "complete", or "error". The control.k3d file is currently unused. 
Each frame directory contains a lock file, a control file named control.k3d and zero-to-many frame resources. The name of the lock file changes to flag the status of the frame as "ready", "running", "complete", or "error". The control.k3d file is an XML file that encodes a set of operations that must be completed successfully to change the status of the frame from "ready" to "complete". Three types of operation are allowed: a "render" operation that executes a pre-configured render command using a fixed set of command-line arguments, a "copy" operation that copies a file from one filesystem location to another; and a "view" operation that displays a bitmap image using the user's choice of image viewer. The frame resources are inputs to the render engine, such as RIB files, texture images, shaders, etc. 
.IP
The k3d-renderjob executable is run with the path to a job directory as an argument. k3d-renderjob updates the job lock file, iterating over each frame directory, spawning an instance of k3d-renderframe for each frame (one at a time). k3d-renderframe is run with the path to a frame directory as an argument, updating the frame lock file, reading the control file, and executing the operations that it specifies.
